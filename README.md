# trigger-context
(Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/trigger-context)

An Android application that enables android	devices	to detect and communicate with each other to make smart decisions 
and automate tasks based upon the information they exchange. 
For instance, the user can configure the application to automatically send a pre-entered message to some contacts 
when the home WiFi is detected (message to parents to signal that the user has reached home)
You could also have the application sync music automatically when devices owned by your friends are detected in 
your vicinity, saving each person the trouble of selecting songs manually and sharing it. 
Many such simple automations can be configured. 
The trigger is always one/multiple devices in the vicinity of your device.
