The idea of the project is to automate tasks in your daily life which can be controlled programmatically. The model consists of a trigger, which might be device detection/ user’s location or time. When triggered, a set of configured conditions are tested and determine if the action is performed. For instance, if you come back home and usually send an SMS to your parents saying that you’ve reached home on a daily basis, this task is repetitive and can be easily automated. Coming home is the trigger in this scenario, this can be achieved by detecting the home desktop. The action performed is the sending of an SMS.
